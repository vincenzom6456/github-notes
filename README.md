<h1>Git</h1>
<p>Git has version control. Version Control is software that keeps track of the changes you make on a certain file.</p>
<p>Git also has a collaboration feature and allows 2 or more people to work onthe same file at the same time.</p> 
<h1>Github</h1>
<p>Github is a web service.</p>
<p>Can be considered a social network for managing projects.</p>
<h1>Repo</h1>
<p>Is basically another word for project.</p>
<p>Can have multiple files attached.</p>
<h1>Commit</h1>
<p>By Commiting changes to a file on a repository it saves the changes you have just made.</p>
<p>YOu can also commit to different branches if you need or want to.</p>
<h1>Collaboration</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Remote: Publicly in the cloud</li>
  <li>Local: On your home device</li>
  <li>When you edit a file on your local device nothing will change on the Remote server until you commit (Save changes), then packets of what has been changed in particular will be sent to the server so that the new changes will become public.</li>
  <li>When you did even a small amount of work you can commit then sometime in the future you can always undo that change that you pushed.</li>
  <li>If you are working collaboratively other people on the central repository can push changes to the files and on both sides can pull the changes that one another made onto their local device.</li>
  <li>When collaboratively working you can push and pull changes on both or all devices.</li>
  <li>This is not the only way to collaborate. You can collaborate through pull requests and many other things, this is why a lot of people use github because it has many collaborative features.</li>
</ol>
